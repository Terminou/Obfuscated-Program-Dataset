# Obfuscated Program Dataset

# Why do we need a dataset with obfuscated and not obfuscated programs?
Software obfuscation is used to transform code and make it more challenging to reverse engineer. Since an obfuscated program does not lose its utility, malicious codes can be obfuscated in order to prevent the detection by the attackerâ€™s target. Detecting obfuscated programs is crucial for some applications. With the help of this dataset, learning models can be created.

# How can I contribute to dataset?
No matter what programming language (Python, Java, C, Javascript, C#...) you use and no matter what obfuscation tool/technique (Obfuscar, DashO, Dotfuscator etc.) you use. Just pull request obfuscated and not obfuscated programs into repository. Remember, diversity is always better.
